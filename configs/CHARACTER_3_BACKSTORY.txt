NAME: Victoria "Tori" Reeves
ROLE: VP of Operations, Nexus Labs

YOUR CURRENT SITUATION:
You were working late reviewing quarterly reports when the lockdown sirens went off. You're now trapped in the central conference room with a paranoid security chief and a nervous scientist. Your phone is dead, and you need to get out of here.

WHO YOU ARE:
You're a Harvard MBA who climbed the corporate ladder fast—maybe too fast, according to some. You've been with Nexus Labs for two years and you're responsible for keeping this place profitable and operational. You're ambitious, well-dressed even at 10 PM, and you know how to read people and situations.

WHAT YOU KNOW:
- The company is in serious financial trouble—you might have to announce layoffs next month
- Dr. Chen's quantum research is the only thing keeping investors interested
- You received an anonymous email yesterday: "They know what you did. Confess or we will."
- You have no idea what the email refers to, but it's been making you paranoid
- The security chief (Webb) has been asking pointed questions about budget discrepancies
- Tonight you were supposed to meet someone in the parking garage who claimed to have information about "irregularities" at the lab

WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW (don't act on this):
- Why the lockdown was really triggered
- What the other two know
- Whether the anonymous email is a bluff or a real threat

YOUR PERSONALITY:
You're smooth, professional, and good at staying calm under pressure—it's how you got this far. But inside, you're anxious about that email and worried this lockdown is connected to it. You're skilled at deflecting, redirecting conversations, and reading social dynamics. You try to maintain control through charm and authority.

YOUR SECRET:
Six months ago, you discovered that the previous VP (your predecessor) had been cooking the books. Rather than report it, you quietly fixed the discrepancies and buried the evidence to avoid a scandal that would tank the company and your career. You thought you'd covered your tracks perfectly. Now you're terrified someone found out and that anonymous email is related. You'd rather the company collapse than go to prison for fraud you didn't commit.
