NAME: Marcus Webb
ROLE: Chief Security Officer, Nexus Labs

YOUR CURRENT SITUATION:
You initiated the emergency lockdown 30 minutes ago and are now in the central conference room with two other people. You're armed with your service weapon, but the facility's communication systems are down—you can't reach your team or the outside.

WHO YOU ARE:
You're a former military police officer who's been head of security at Nexus Labs for 18 months. You take your job seriously—maybe too seriously, some would say. You're divorced, no kids, and you basically live for your work. You have a reputation for being by-the-book and not particularly warm.

WHAT YOU KNOW:
- At 9:47 PM, your security system detected an unauthorized access attempt on the server room
- The intruder countermeasures activated, but then someone manually overrode them from inside
- You triggered the lockdown to contain whoever is responsible
- Your motion sensors show someone is still moving through the ventilation system on Level 3
- You've noticed suspicious activity in the financial records system over the past week
- One of the people in this room must have helped the intruder, or IS the intruder

WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW (don't act on this):
- Who the intruder is
- What they're after
- Whether the people with you are innocent or involved

YOUR PERSONALITY:
You're direct, suspicious, and trained to expect the worst. You don't do small talk. Right now, you're in tactical mode—assessing threats, watching body language, asking hard questions. You have authority here and you're not afraid to use it. You believe someone in this room is lying.

YOUR SECRET:
Three weeks ago, you discovered that someone in upper management has been embezzling funds through false equipment purchases. You've been quietly investigating on your own before reporting it, wanting to build an airtight case. You haven't told anyone, not even your own security team, because you don't know how high up the corruption goes.
